# Active Manifold Learning Toolbox
_AML_ is a toolbox for different active manifold learning methods. 
Active manifold learning combines manifold landmarking with semi-supervised manifold learning: given unlabeled samples of a manifold, we need to landmark and label a subset of them and ensure that the labels of the remaining samples have small estimation errors.
